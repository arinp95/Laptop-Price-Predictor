# Laptop Price Predictor 💻

A machine learning regression project aimed at predicting laptop prices using a dataset of around 1400 data points sourced from Kaggle. 

**Dataset:** [Laptop Price Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birajkhatri/laptop-price-datasets)

## 📈 Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, outliers, and data normalization.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Understanding data distribution and identifying key features.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features to improve model performance.
4. **Model Selection:** Testing various regression models:
   - Linear Regression
   - Lasso Regression
   - Ridge Regression
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Decision Tree
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Random Forest
   - Extra Trees
   - AdaBoost
   - Gradient Boosting
   - XGBoost
   - Voting Regressor
   - Stacking Regressor

## ⚙️ Model Evaluation
Models are evaluated using the following metrics:
- **R² Score**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**

The best-performing model is saved for deployment.

## 🌐 Streamlit Web Application
A Streamlit web application is developed for easy user interaction with the model.
