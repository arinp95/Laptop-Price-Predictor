This project provides valuable insights into the factors that influence laptop prices and can be used to make informed decisions when buying a laptop.
# Laptop Price Predictor üíª

A machine learning regression project aimed at predicting laptop prices using a dataset of around 1400 data points sourced from Kaggle. 

**Dataset:** [Laptop Price Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birajkhatri/laptop-price-datasets)

## üìà Project Workflow
# Laptop_Price_Prediction
This project aims to predict laptop prices based on various features using regression models.

The main steps involved in this project are:

1. **Data Collection**: The data for this project is collected from various online sources. The dataset includes features such as the brand, screen size, processor type, RAM, storage type and size, graphics card, and more.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: The collected data is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: EDA is performed to understand the data better. This includes visualizing the distribution of different features and their relationship with the laptop price.

4. **Feature Engineering**: New features are created based on existing ones to improve the model‚Äôs performance. Feature selection techniques are used to select the most relevant features.

5. **Model Building**: Various regression models are trained on the preprocessed data. This includes linear regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression, and more.

6. **Model Evaluation**: Testing the performance of the models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.:
   - Linear Regression
   - Lasso Regression
   - Ridge Regression
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Decision Tree
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Random Forest
   - Extra Trees
   - AdaBoost
   - Gradient Boosting
   - XGBoost
   - Voting Regressor
   - Stacking Regressor

7. Model Selection and Deployment: The model with the best performance is selected and deployed for predicting laptop prices.
